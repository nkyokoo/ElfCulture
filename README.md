# elf-culture-eu4

This mod is very basic, It just adds a Elf culture with elven names, also it adds a custom religion. Elves don't really believe in a god the same way as humans do, but not all elves are the same.

I will update the mod to include other features and fix some things. 

There might be different variation of elf culture, such as high elf, dark elf, or wood elf.

This mod is purely open-source, there won't be any custom advisor potraits or elf soldiers until someone capable of that decides to contribute to that purpose.

## using the mod
This culture won't appear in the game by natural since there's no existing countries using it, the only way to use it is to make a custom nation.
